# dictionary
As we know the manual processing is quite tedious, time consuming, less accurate in comparison to
computerised processing, so the main objective of my project is to computerise the tough task of
finding the words in a standard English dictionary. I have tried to create a friendly user-interface
which is time-saving as well as lot of paper work is reduced.
I have used the Eclipse Helios platform for coding at the front end. All the queries used for
extracting the data from the database are MySQL queries. All the various frames and applets have
been created using core java language. I have used MySQL 5.0 for creating the database.
All the words of the dictionary are stored in a table called “stock”. Also there are enhanced options
which store your favourite words and recently viewed words as well. The user can also access the
pronunciation of different words by clicking on the sound button. The several vocabulary games
have also been included by me so that the user can learn while having fu at the same time. User
guide is also a part of my project so that the user can easily access all the features of the dictionary
and to help the user at each step with the various features available.
